# About I Ching Divination
The I Ching is an ancient Chinese divinatory text. Many enjoy mapping their patterns of experience with its forecasts. I wanted to write a program that would approximate the feel of yarrow stick divination, the most historically accurate way of consulting the I Ching. There are other methods of consulting it for which software already exists. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching_divination#Software_methods. 

#  How the Yarrow Stick Method Works
Traditionally, yarrow stalks that come from an area close to the diviners home or a location with sentimental value should be used. In 2018, vertical lines local to our own PC screens must suffice. In the diagram below, each of the 49 vertical lines represents a yarrow stalk.

#  How My Software Works
First the user should consider a situation that they would like to focus the divination on.
After starting the program, the user presses the spacebar to indicate where they would like to halve the yarrow stalks, which is the key element for creating a unique forecast.

The hexagram is displayed one line at a time, and all together at the end. Note that the first line you divine appears at the bottom of the hexagram, the next line at the second to bottom, etc. This is how yarrow stick divination is traditionally done, so that the hexagram is created from bottom to top. Once you have created your hexagram, you can refer to the chart below to find your hexagram number. If you are new to using the I Ching, I recommend converting "--x--" to "-----", and "--o--" to "-- --". Read more about changing lines if you wish to learn more on this.

Our hexagram from the example above is #20, called è§€ or Viewing. Visit http://wengu.tartarie.com/wg/wengu.php?l=Yijing&no=20 for more information. Hope you enjoy using the program. :)
